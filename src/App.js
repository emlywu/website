            Hi! I'm a software engineer based in the New York City metropolitan area and a 2023 graduate of Cornell University. 
            I am passionate about building technology that's not just functional, but also intuitive and thoughtful. For 
            me, good code is clean, reusable, and crafted with purpose â€” whether I'm working on the back-end infrastructure 
            or perfecting the user interface, I'm always thinking about how to make things better for the people 
            who will use them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've had the chance to work with a variety of companies, where I've learned a lot about solving real-world 
            problems through code. As a developer, I'm meticulous and dedicated to delivering quality work, but I also 
            love learning and experimenting with new technologies. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me solving 
            puzzles (I'm really into the New York Times daily puzzles), reading science-fiction books (ask me about my favorites!), 
            or trying out a new Pilates class to balance out my screen time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm always looking for ways to grow as an engineer and collaborate with others who are excited about 
            building meaningful, human-centered tech. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect!
